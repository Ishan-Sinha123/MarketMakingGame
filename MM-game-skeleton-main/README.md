# Market Making Competition

## Introduction

Welcome to the Market Making Competition! In this challenge, you'll be developing a robust market-making strategy to maximize profits while managing risks in a simulated trading environment.

Market making is a trading strategy that involves providing liquidity to the market by simultaneously offering to buy and sell a particular asset. Market makers profit from the bid-ask spread, which is the difference between the price at which they are willing to buy (bid) and the price at which they are willing to sell (ask). By continuously quoting prices and executing trades, market makers help to ensure that there is always a buyer or seller available, thus enhancing market efficiency and stability.

## Your Role

Imagine you are a leading trading firm specializing in market making for a single stock. Your task is to develop a market-making strategy that outperforms the competition and generates the highest profits.

## Getting Started

1. **Folk this repo**

2. **Implement Your Strategy**
   - Implement your market-making strategy in the `SimpleMarketMaker` class located in `maker.py`.
   - Your strategy should be implemented in the `update` method, which is responsible for determining the new bid and ask prices, as well as the corresponding buy and sell volumes.

3. **Understand the `update` Method**
   - The `update` method has the following signature:
     ```python
     def update(self, prev_bid_price, prev_ask_price, holding, moneny, timestamp) -> Tuple[float, int, float, int, OrderType]:
         pass
     ```
   - **Inputs:**
     - `prev_bid_price` (float): The price at which the simulated market was willing to buy the asset in the previous interval.
     - `prev_ask_price` (float): The price at which the simulated market was willing to sell the asset in the previous interval.
     - `holding`: (int) the number of stocks you are holding from previous interval
     - `money`: (float) the money you have from previous interval.
     - `timestamp` (int): The timestamp of the current interval.
   - **Outputs:**
     - A tuple containing:
       - `newBid` (float): The new bid price you are willing to offer.
       - `bidSize` (int): The size of the bid order.
       - `newAsk` (float): The new ask price you are willing to offer.
       - `askSize` (int): The size of the ask order.
       - `OrderType` (OrderType): An object representing the type of order (market or limit) and the time frame (from_time and to_time) for limit orders.

4. **Run the Simulation**
   - Use your strategy in `main.py` to run the simulation.

5. **Setup Environment**
   - Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:
     ```sh
     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

6. **Execute the Simulation**
   - Run the full simulation using:
     ```sh
     python main.py
     ```

   - Quick run for test
     ``` sh
     python main.py -f
     ```

## Logs

- The log for each run is stored in the `log` directory.

## Scoring and Evaluation

Your market-making strategy will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Profitability**: The total profit generated by your strategy over the course of the simulation.
2. **Risk Management**: The ability to manage risk and maintain a stable portfolio.
3. **Efficiency**: The responsiveness and adaptability of your strategy to changing market conditions.

The winner of the competition will be the participant who demonstrates the most effective and profitable market-making strategy.
